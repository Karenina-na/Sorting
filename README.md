# üéâ Sorting-Algorithm-Interface-Framework

The Sorting Algorithm Interface Framework project constitutes the capstone assignment of the Algorithm Design and Integration Laboratory course at Northwestern Polytechnical University.

## üìö Introduction

The role of sorting algorithms in engineering is of paramount importance. Therefore, the selection, utilization, and design of sorting algorithms in various engineering applications significantly influence task performance.

This project encompasses the implementation, quantitative comparison, and evaluation of the performance of commonly employed sorting algorithms. It entails an analysis of their applicable conditions

The project has realized the following sorting algorithms:

- insertion sort
- bubble sort
- selection sort
- shell sort
- quicksort
- heapsort
- radix sort
- merge sort

These algorithms have been executed on datasets of considerable size, encompassing ordered data, reversed data, as well as random sequences generated from uniform, Gaussian, and Poisson distributions.

Performance assessment of these algorithms has been conducted through the examination of comparison operations, data movements, and computation times. Within the implemented algorithms, a statistical module has been incorporated to track and report the number of comparison operations, data movements, and computation times. The results are generated and subjected to correctness testing. The project also boasts a user-friendly interface, appropriate application requirements analysis, and a well-conceived application design, which will be credited accordingly.

## üöÄ How to Use

Our code repository supports direct downloading and usage, but we recommend using the `git clone` command to clone the entire code repository to your local machine for better code management and updates. Here are the specific instructions:

1.Open your terminal or command prompt.

2.Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the code repository.

3.Run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Karenina-na/Deep-Learning-Framework.git
```

4.Wait for the cloning process to complete. Once finished, you will have a local copy of the code repository on your machine.

5.After cloning the code repository, you can use the `cd` command to navigate to the specific folder of the model and run the code.

6.Build the project

windows - MinGW - ninja

```terminal
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja -B ./cmake-build-release ..
cmake --build ./cmake-build-release --target Sorting_Algorithm_Interface_Framework -- -j 14
```

7.Run by double-clicking the executable file in the build directory.

```terminal
./cmake-build-release/Sorting_Algorithm_Interface_Framework.exe
```

8.If you want to build for release, you can use the following command:

open Qt (Mingw) terminal

```terminal
cd ./cmake-build-release
mkdir release
windeployqt Sorting_Algorithm_Interface_Framework.exe -dir ./release -exe
```

then copy the executable file to the release directory

the release directory is ready to use
